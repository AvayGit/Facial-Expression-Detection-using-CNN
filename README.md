Facial Expression Recognition using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

A deep learning project that detects **human facial emotions** from grayscale images using a custom-built **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **FER2013 dataset**.

---
Overview

Facial expressions are a powerful indicator of human emotions. This project builds an end-to-end facial expression recognition system that classifies facial images into seven emotional categories:

Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral

The complete workflow is implemented in Google Colab and demonstrates the entire pipeline from dataset loading and preprocessing to model training and feature visualization.

Dataset

FER2013 Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ltonXDdaCc-iRyV79bPBxaWPpUn28wB/view 

* Image size: `48 × 48` (grayscale)
* Total samples: ~35,000 facial images
* Classes: 7 emotion categories
* Format: CSV file with pixel values as strings

Model Architecture

The CNN architecture used in this project:

```text
Input: 48×48×1

Conv2D (32 filters, 3×3) → ReLU → MaxPooling  
Conv2D (64 filters, 3×3) → ReLU → MaxPooling  
Conv2D (128 filters, 3×3) → ReLU → MaxPooling  
Conv2D (256 filters, 3×3) → ReLU → MaxPooling  

Flatten  
Dense (1000 units, ReLU)  
Dense (7 units, Softmax)
```

This layered structure enables the model to learn:

* Low-level features (edges, textures)
* Mid-level facial parts (eyes, mouth)
* High-level emotional patterns
