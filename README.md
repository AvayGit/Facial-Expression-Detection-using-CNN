This project implements a Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the FER2013 dataset. The model classifies facial images into seven human emotion categories:

Angry,

Disgust,

Fear,

Happy,

Sad,

Surprise,

Neutral


The complete pipeline includes:

Loading FER2013 dataset from Google Drive,

Preprocessing grayscale facial images,

Building a deep CNN model,

Training and validating the model,

Visualizing convolution, activation, 

and pooling layers
