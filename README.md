# Facial-Expression-Detection-using-CNN
This project implements a Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the FER2013 dataset. The model classifies facial images into seven human emotion categories:  Angry  Disgust  Fear  Happy  Sad  Surprise  Neutral.
